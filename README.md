# make-markov
A delightfully simple markov chain library.

This library hasn't been tested too throughly, but it will work as intended. The only aspects that haven't been tested are the assert 
statements meant to guard against missuse. 

Changes for the future:

  1. Fix up documentation.
  1. Create additional tests.
  1. Add function to take a list
     of symbols and turn them 
     into an edge list that the
     MarkovChain object will be
     able to interpret.
